	"review": "If you thought Black Panther the movie was fantastic, you might want to check out the groundbreaking comics behind it. Marvel’s first black comic hero, Black Panther, was first created in 1966 and introduced in issue 52 of Fantastic Four. That’s over 50 years’ worth of comics to catch up on! To bring you up to speed, we recommend borrowing ‘Black Panther: Who is the Black Panther?’. Released by Marvel Comics in 2018, this collection brings together the various comics featuring Black Panther in one book. The story traces the origins of a warrior-king Black Panther, also known as T'Challa, who governs Wakanda, a fictional African nation. Black Panther is put to the test when a powerful enemy attacks Wakanda."

Hilarious and heart-breaking, Wonder Boys takes us on a journey with Grady, an ageing writer. Once a literary phenomenon, Grady is now struggling with a behemoth of  a novel meant to be his magnum opus. Plus, it doesn’t help that Grady’s personal life seems to be unravelling too."
